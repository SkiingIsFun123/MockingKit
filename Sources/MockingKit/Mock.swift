 This class can be inherited any classes that should be used
 as mock implementation, e.g. when unit testing.
 
 The class implements `Mockable` by using itself as ``mock``.
 Use it instead of implementing `Mockable` whenever possible,
 since it saves you a little code for each mock.
 
 See ``Mockable`` for information about what a mockable type
 can do.
