 This class can be inherited any classes that should be used
 as mock implementation, e.g. when unit testing.
 
 The class implements `Mockable` by using itself as a `mock`.
 Use it instead of `Mockable` whenever possible, since it is
 saving you a little bit of code for each mock.
 
 See `Mockable` for more information about what mocks can do.
